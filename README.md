# String-Based Emoji Collection

## A Brief History of Text-Based Emotions

Long before animated GIFs and colorful emoji sets dominated our digital communication, we expressed ourselves through creative combinations of keyboard characters. This art form began in the Western world with simple emoticons like `:)` and `:(` in the early days of computer communication.

Meanwhile, in Japan, a more elaborate form of text-based expression was evolving: kaomoji (顔文字) - literally "face characters." Unlike Western emoticons which you read by tilting your head 90 degrees, kaomoji are designed to be viewed straight on. These artistic text arrangements used a wide variety of Unicode characters to create complex, expressive faces and figures that could convey nuanced emotions beyond the limitations of standard punctuation.

What makes these string-based emojis so special is that they transmit emotional context through typography rather than imagery, preserving the textual nature of communication while adding emotional richness. They represent a beautiful intersection of linguistic expression and visual creativity, allowing us to infuse our digital conversations with personality using only our keyboards.
